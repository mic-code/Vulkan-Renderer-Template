# CodeVk_Renderer: A Vulkan-Based RenderGraph Renderer

CodeVk_Renderer is a lightweight Vulkan-based rendering engine that leverages a RenderGraph architecture. It aims to simplify the development of graphics applications by providing an easy-to-use interface for rapid prototyping while maintaining the flexibility and control of Vulkan's explicit API.

## Code Usage

### Basic Usage

To get started with developing your own renderer, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Renderer Class**
   
   Inherit from `BaseRenderer` and create your own renderer (e.g., `ForwardRenderer`). You can use the provided examples as references.

   ```cpp
   class ForwardRenderer : public BaseRenderer {
       public:
           ForwardRenderer(ENGINE::Core* core, WindowProvider* windowProvider,
                          ENGINE::DescriptorAllocator* descriptorAllocator);
           ~ForwardRenderer() override;
           void SetRenderOperation(ENGINE::InFlightQueue* inflightQueue) override;
           void ReloadShaders() override;
   };
   ```

2. **Initialize Buffers, Shaders, and Images**
   
   - **Load Models**: Use `ModelLoader` to load 3D models into the application. For example, you can load a GLTF model and create vertex and index buffers.
   - **Vertex and Index Buffers**: Create these buffers using `ENGINE::Buffer`. The buffers store the vertex data and indices required for rendering your model.
   - **Shaders**: Load vertex and fragment shaders using the `ENGINE::Shader` utility. Paths for these shaders can be configured to point to custom shader files.
   
   ```cpp
   ModelLoader::GetInstance()->LoadGLTF(modelPath, model);
   vertexBuffer = std::make_unique<ENGINE::Buffer>(
       physicalDevice, logicalDevice, vk::BufferUsageFlagBits::eVertexBuffer,
       vk::MemoryPropertyFlagBits::eHostVisible | vk::MemoryPropertyFlagBits::eHostCoherent,
       sizeof(M_Vertex3D) * model.vertices.size(), model.vertices.data());
   indexBuffer = std::make_unique<ENGINE::Buffer>(
       physicalDevice, logicalDevice, vk::BufferUsageFlagBits::eIndexBuffer,
       vk::MemoryPropertyFlagBits::eHostVisible | vk::MemoryPropertyFlagBits::eHostCoherent,
       sizeof(uint32_t) * model.indices.size(), model.indices.data());
   ```

3. **Render Pass Configuration**
   
   Define a render pass in the RenderGraph using `AddPass()`. Configure attachments, shaders, and pipeline layout. The `AddPass()` function is used to create a new rendering pass, which specifies how the rendering pipeline is organized and which resources are needed.

   ```cpp
   auto renderNode = renderGraphRef->AddPass(forwardPassName);
   renderNode->SetVertShader(vertShader.get());
   renderNode->SetFragShader(fragShader.get());
   renderNode->SetFramebufferSize(windowProvider->GetWindowSize());
   renderNode->SetPipelineLayoutCI(layoutCreateInfo);
   renderNode->SetVertexInput(vertexInput);
   renderNode->AddColorAttachmentOutput("color", colInfo);
   renderNode->SetDepthAttachmentOutput("depth", depthInfo);
   renderNode->AddColorBlendConfig(ENGINE::BlendConfigs::B_OPAQUE);
   renderNode->SetDepthConfig(ENGINE::DepthConfigs::D_ENABLE);
   renderNode->AddSamplerResource("sampler", imageShipper.imageView.get());
   renderNode->AddStorageResource("storageImage", computeStorage);
   renderNode->BuildRenderGraphNode();
   ```

4. **Set Render Operations**
   
   Define the rendering logic by setting render operations within the `SetRenderOperation()` function, using `vk::CommandBuffer` to bind resources and draw. This includes:
   - Binding descriptor sets.
   - Binding vertex and index buffers.
   - Issuing draw commands for the loaded model.

   ```cpp
   commandBuffer.bindDescriptorSets(renderGraphRef->GetNode(forwardPassName)->pipelineType,
                                    renderGraphRef->GetNode(forwardPassName)->pipelineLayout.get(), 0, 1,
                                    &descriptorCache->dstSet.get(), 0 , nullptr);

   commandBuffer.bindVertexBuffers(0, 1, &vertexBuffer->bufferHandle.get(), &offset);
   commandBuffer.bindIndexBuffer(indexBuffer->bufferHandle.get(), 0, vk::IndexType::eUint32);
   commandBuffer.drawIndexed(model.indicesCount[i], 1, model.firstIndices[i],
                             static_cast<int32_t>(model.firstVertices[i]), 0);
   ```

5. **Recreate Resources as Needed**

   Implement `ReloadShaders()` to support shader reloading. This function allows you to modify shaders and reload them without restarting the entire application, making the development cycle more iterative.

   ```cpp
   void ReloadShaders() override {
       auto renderNode = renderGraphRef->GetNode(forwardPassName);
       renderNode->RecreateResources();
   }
   ```

### Descriptor Handling Methods

CodeVk_Renderer supports two different methods for handling descriptors: **Descriptor Cache** and **Descriptor Writer**. Below, we describe each method and its application in the rendering engine.

#### 1. Descriptor Cache (Automatic Management)

The **Descriptor Cache** approach is used primarily in `ForwardRenderer`. It automatically manages descriptors required by different shaders. This method abstracts away the low-level descriptor management, making it easier to set up a rendering pipeline without repetitive and manual descriptor binding logic.

- **Setup**: The `Descriptor Cache` is configured by extracting the layout information from the shaders, and the cache builds descriptor sets accordingly.
- **Usage**: During the initialization of `ForwardRenderer`, descriptors are populated by calling `descriptorCache->AddShaderInfo()`, followed by `descriptorCache->BuildDescriptorsCache()`. This setup handles the descriptor requirements for vertex and fragment shaders seamlessly.

```cpp
vertShader->sParser->GetLayout(builder);
fragShader->sParser->GetLayout(builder);
descriptorCache->AddShaderInfo(*vertShader->sParser.get());
descriptorCache->AddShaderInfo(*fragShader->sParser.get());
descriptorCache->BuildDescriptorsCache(descriptorAllocatorRef, vk::ShaderStageFlagBits::eVertex | vk::ShaderStageFlagBits::eFragment);
```

#### 2. Descriptor Writer (Manual Management)

The **Descriptor Writer** approach is used in `ComputeRenderer`. This method provides explicit control over how descriptors are allocated and written to, giving developers more fine-grained control over the descriptor lifecycle.

- **Setup**: The `Descriptor Writer` uses a builder (`writerBuilder`) to create descriptor sets manually. This approach involves creating descriptor layouts and using a descriptor allocator to allocate descriptor sets.
- **Usage**: In `ComputeRenderer`, descriptors are configured using `writerBuilder.AddWriteImage()`, and the set is updated explicitly with `writerBuilder.UpdateSet()`. This allows full control over each descriptor’s configuration and usage.

```cpp
compShader->sParser.get()->GetLayout(builder);
dstLayout = builder.BuildBindings(logicalDevice, vk::ShaderStageFlagBits::eCompute);
dstSet = descriptorAllocatorRef->Allocate(core->logicalDevice.get(), dstLayout.get());
writerBuilder.AddWriteImage(0, computeImageView.get(), computeImageSampler->samplerHandle.get(), vk::ImageLayout::eGeneral, vk::DescriptorType::eStorageImage);
writerBuilder.UpdateSet(core->logicalDevice.get(), dstSet.get());
```

### Example: Forward Renderer Setup

Here's a detailed example of how `ForwardRenderer` is set up:

1. **Initialization**
   - The `ForwardRenderer` class initializes by loading a GLTF model and creating Vulkan buffers (`vertexBuffer` and `indexBuffer`).
   - Default image and shader paths are established for the resources required.
   - The descriptor cache is configured to manage the shader's descriptor requirements automatically.

2. **Render Pass Setup**
   - A RenderGraph node (`AddPass`) is created to add the rendering pass with attachments and pipeline configurations.
   - Vertex and fragment shaders are loaded, and descriptors are configured for managing resource bindings.

3. **Render Operation Logic**
   - In `SetRenderOperation()`, use the `vk::CommandBuffer` to bind resources, issue draw commands, and execute the rendering of the GLTF model.

4. **Swapchain Handling**
   - Handles recreating the swapchain and updating framebuffer resources if the window is resized or the swapchain becomes invalid.


## Hot Reloading Shaders

To reload shaders during runtime, press the `R` key or invoke the `ReloadShaders()` function in `ForwardRenderer`. This enables quick iteration and testing of shader modifications without restarting the application.


### Customization Tips

- **Shaders**: Add your custom shaders under the shaders path and update `ForwardRenderer` to use them.
- **Models**: Replace the GLTF model path to use your own models.
- **UI**: Use the ImGui integration to add custom UI elements for controlling your scene.
